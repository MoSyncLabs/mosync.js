MoSync HTML5 javascript runtime
===

### About:
This is an framework that introduces the possibility to run applications created for the MoSync SDK in an HTML5 enabled browser. In other words this means that programs written in pure C/C++ can run in a browser.

It needs a program and a resource file built using the MoSync SDK. Programs are interpreted and are therefore able to return to the main loop at regular intervals. This way the javascript runtime isn't blocked by the execution.

One file called maapi.js is tightly associated with a specific MoSync version. A version compatible with the latest stable version of the MoSync SDK is commited but if you want to use a newer / older version of the MoSync SDK we strongly suggest you to download and build tools/idl2 in the MoSync source of the version you want to use it with. In the Output folder a maapi.js file will be placed, and in order to use it it is just a matter of copying it from that folder.

### Resource types supported:
Placeholders, binaries, unloaded binaries (implemented as binaries), images.
